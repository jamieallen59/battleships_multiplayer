#BattleShips

The game is ready to play when there are two players initialized with a board each and each board has 5 ships placed. 

By default it is player1's go first and after each shot it will switch the turns until there is a winner.

A game_setup.rb file sets up the game to a ready start placing each ship from columns A through to E vertically.
